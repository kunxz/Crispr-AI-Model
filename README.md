CRISPR AI MODEL

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict deletion lengths in CRISPR repair outcomes. The model is evaluated across multiple random seeds to test.


Key Metrics:

	•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual deletion lengths. Lower values indicate better performance.
	•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual deletion lengths. Lower values indicate more accurate predictions.
	•	R² (R-squared): Measures how well the model’s predictions match the actual data. Higher values (closer to 1) indicate a better fit.
